# The first AI Generated Kodi Addon?
99% of this code was generated by ChatGPT. I provided the specifications, and at times, suggested corrections when they were large enough to justify it to continue saying the code was generated by the AI. The initial versions, while mostly ok, still had issues, and as I asked it to add features, the time it took to get everything correct increased. I estimate 4-5 hours of back and forth were required.

I also provided testing and feedback with errors from the python interpreter. The icon was generated in Stable Diffusion, where I had it spit out many and picked the coolest. The only modification was to delete the white background in favor of transparency.

In general, the addon was an experiment, and also built to add a piece of missing functionality to Kodi, for allowing the user to stream video content from sites that have HLS or embedded video, but no addons support them. 

The only requirement outside Kodi and the standard python libs is the yt-dlp application and library. Tested only under Linux, pull requests welcome, but preference is that you attempt to add features/fix things by having ChatGPT attempt to do so first.

# Program Description (Written by ChatGPT)

This Kodi addon allows users to search for and play videos from any URL that is supported by yt-dlp. It has a menu with two options: "Search" and "Search from history". The "Search" option prompts the user to enter a search query, searches for videos matching the query using yt-dlp, and then allows the user to play one of the resulting videos. The "Search from history" option displays a list of previous search queries and allows the user to select one to repeat the search. The addon also has a "Clear history" option which allows the user to clear the history of previous search queries.

# Installation

Grab the code zip from the green dropdown button to the upper right, and then install that zip into Kodi as an addon.
